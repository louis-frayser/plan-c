# The Plan

## Current strategy

1. Save formdata to disk after agregating changes.
2. If saved data exists in a recent file, use it rather than the original
   file on disk.
3. If the current date is newer the the saved data,
   stash the disk data to history; start with fresh values
   for today.
   
## FIXME
2. Crash is ':' is missig from input timesring.
3. Aparently display is alphabetical order, but form is canonical.
   Decide on with to use in both places.
4. On 1st entry activites (probably the "0:00" ones) dissapear from form.
   Upon adding times for the missing, they apear at top of form,
   no in alpahbetical order.
   
   ### Fixed
	   1. FIXED:  Adding 1hr of time to an existing crashes the response.
	   #f instead of number: is the errr.

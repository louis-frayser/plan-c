* The Plan

** Current strategy
1. Save form data to disk after agregating changes.


   
*** Done Not Tested
1. If saved data exists in a recent file, use it rather than the original
   file on disk. -- #'retrive-plan-c
2. If the current date is newer than that of the saved data,
   stash the disk data to history; start with fresh values
   for today. -- #'retrieve-plan-c
** FIXME
1. Crash if ':' is missig from input timesring.
2. Upon  1st entry activites (probably the "0:00" ones) dissapear from form.
2.2 Upon adding missing activities, they apear at top of form,
   not in alpahbetical order.Aparently display is alphabetical order, but form is canonical.
   Decide on with to use in both places.
3. Make form-label text bold.

*** Fixed
   1. Adding 1hr of time to an existing crashes the response.
      #f instead of number was the errr.

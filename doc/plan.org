* The Plan

** Current design, repair and enhancement strategies
*** DONE Save form data to disk after aggregating changes.
1. Saving is done, but decided to save before aggregation, so
   more detail is preserved. This was done be accident, but
   the result seems better than the original [no pun ] plan.
 
*** DONE If saved data exists in a recent file, use it rather than the original
    file on disk. -- #'retrieve-plan-c
*** DONE Save new daily data to separate file directories on disk
    If the current date is newer than that of the saved data,
    stash the disk data to history; start with fresh values
    for today. -- #'retrieve-plan-c

** FIXME
*** Critical
**** STARTED Activities are definitely disappearing from the WWW display
     1. After entry, some previous entries disappear. Mon 10:04:39
     2. In the database, it seems the missing value (time-duration)
        was assigned to  the wrong activity
***** I suspect that 1 and 2 above are due to data entered at the time of timeout when all values are zeroed forced input to register jusing categor 0 and activity 0.y
      This does not explain disapearing items, though.  Those missing items do show up upon restart.
      Suggest, do not zero and reload categories except for the inital time, by setting a flag after initialiazation. FInit=treue.  And unless FInit ... for the intialization code.
**** DONE Crashes if ':' is missing from input timesring.
     1. Also fails on '::' - to many colons.
     2. (note: add validation 1st to the server, then to the client)
         validation need to occur before storage.

**** DONE Crash on input of hours
- Adding 1 hr of time to an existing crashes the response.
  #f instead of number was the error.

*** Bad
**** Redirect/get is not correct--sends the page to nowhere.
**** Items entered from another client do show
     I want to redirect back the start page.
*** Annoying
**** DONE Often it seems that WWW-form input is not excepted and needs to be repeated.
     Fixed by adding a confirmation dialog.  No posts can happen without consent.
**** TODO Filter out inputs > 16 hrs in the validation.  Just entered 30:00 instead of 0:30.
**** TODO Date a top of form is static; need to be updated on refresh (or clock chage)

*** Cosmetic
**** DONE Make form-label text bold.
**** TODO Fix clock background color.

*** Wish List
**** STARTED Make the amount of detail displayed adjustable
     It was not anticipated, but by saving data as activities rather than as  plans, more
     detail is available (the date and time and any repetitions of an activity are
       now available.
      1. It would be nice to provide a version of the display with like
         activities aggregated. As the display with the new detail is now
	 different but still interesting.
      2. An ability to show all detail including times activities were performed
         is  also desired.
**** PENDING Add time of day to page 
**** Add total time to page
**** Add a Notes sub validate to Activity
**** Expand the mutiple-instrument fields in music practice
